# Gents Agency JavaScript Style Guide

This guide extends on the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). Go there if you want to read up on the code style recommendations.

## Exceptions

The few exceptions we make at Gents are listed below:

 - Parens are always required in arrow functions
 - Anonymous functions have to be named for easier debugging
 - Constructor call have to be capitalized, except when initializing an object property
 - We use tabs, not spaces
